//llustration: Switch Statement//
//==>:switch statement is useful when you need to select one of several alternatives based on the value of an 
//integer or character type variable
//==>:The expression must evaluate to an int, short, byte, or char. It canâ€™t be a long or a floating-point type.
//==>:The last line of each case group is a break statement, which causes the entire switch statement to end.
//==>:default statement is executed only if none of the previous case constants match the switch expression.
//==>:A break statement causes control to skip to the end of the switch statement if the condition is tru and executed.
